If there is technicaly 2000 clips for the week timerange, you won't be able to see the last 1000. This count limitation does NOT includes keyword filtering. This filter is applied on top of the initial search. If only 3 clips are matching the keyword in the 1000 clips, and also 3 in the next 1000, you won't see the last ones as the clips below the top 1000 are not retrieved by the API. It's recommended to break down searches into smaller timeranges for accuracy using custom timerange."
